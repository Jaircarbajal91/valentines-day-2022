Things I want to say

Things I love about her
  - booty
  - her laugh
  - her eyes
  - her hair
  - shes always there for me
  - she supports me
  - she is ok with my imperfections
  - she always listens

Things that drive me crazy
  - shes moody
  - shes bossy
  - she thinks that because shes hot she can do whatever she wants

How much I love her
  - How she makes me feel
  - How great of a mother she already is
  - How we're meant for eachother
  -

How married life has been


Where life can go
  - Plans
  -
